# Improved Choroid Plexus Segmentation using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

This repository focuses on the study of choroid plexus and its crucial role in CSF-based clearance systems. The transported CSF proteins including AÎ² to the blood by transporter lined epithelium of the choroid plexus. The non-invasive imaging technique for this study is T1-weighted MRIs. Prior to this, Freesurfer was used for automatic choroid plexus segmentation but the limitation was improved using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) which gave more accurate results. We've tried & tested this algorithm extensively against manual segmentations as well as Freesurfer.
